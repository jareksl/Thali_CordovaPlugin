/**
 * @classdesc This class will listen for
 * {@link module:thaliNotificationClient.event:peerAdvertisesDataForUs} events
 * and then schedule replications.
 *
 * If we receive a notification for a peer that is on our list then we will
 * check to see if we have already enqueued a job for them. If we have then we
 * will have to kill it and create a new job since a second notification
 * should really only have happened if some the values for the peer have
 * changed. If there is no enqueued job or if there is a running job then we
 * must enqueue a replication work item.
 *
 * Note: Functionality below is blocked on https://github.com/thaliproject/Thali_CordovaPlugin/issues/734
 * If we receive a notification that a peer is no longer available and there
 * is a queued job for that peer then we will remove the queued job. If there
 * is a running job then we will leave that job alone as presumably it will
 * fail on its own or succeed since notifications that peers have gone isn't
 * an exact science.
 *
 * It is possible for us to discover the same peer over two different
 * transports (say Bluetooth and WiFi). In that case we treat each transport
 * separately. In other words, we treat the combination of transport and user
 * ID as a single value so that if we simultaneously find the same peer over
 * two transports then we will schedule two replications. It is up to the peer
 * pool manager to detect when we are trying to do the same action type for
 * the same peer over two different transports and to then pick which one it
 * prefers (if any, maybe it wants both).
 *
 * @public
 * @param {PouchDB} PouchDB The factory we will use to create the database we
 * will replicate all changes to.
 * @param {string} localDbName The name of the local DB. The name of the remote DB could be either
 * http://[host from discovery]:[port from discovery]/[BASE_DB_PATH]/[name] where name is
 * taken from pouchDB.info's db_name field or where name is provided during runtime to
 * {@link module:ThaliReplicationPeerAction.start} when it is being started.
